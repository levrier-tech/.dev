# Claude Code — Lévrier Tech workspace

Full canonical rules (commit format, restrictions, language) live in
[AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md). This file adds Claude Code-specific context.

## Workspace layout

All repos are cloned as siblings at `/workspaces/<name>` by the `org-workspace` devcontainer
feature (not host bind-mounted — that's what makes the devcontainer work on GitHub Codespaces as
well as local Docker Desktop/WSL2), and open together in `levrier-tech.code-workspace`. The clones live in
a named Docker volume, so a plain "Rebuild Container" keeps uncommitted/unpushed work; only a full
teardown (`docker volume rm`, deleted Codespace) resets them to a fresh clone of `origin/main`.
`.dev` itself is the one repo that's genuinely host bind-mounted, so it's unaffected either way.
**This is a safety net, not a substitute for pushing** — commit and push before anything that
could destroy the underlying Docker volumes.

| Path | Repo | Role |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| `/workspaces/.dev` | `.dev` | Orchestration workspace + unified DevContainer + canonical agent rules |
| `/workspaces/.github` | `.github` | Org-wide GitHub config (community files, templates, profile) |
| `/workspaces/brigid` | `brigid` | Main project repository |

## Common gotchas

**Commit scopes**: always read `scopes.json` at the active repo root before choosing a scope.
Never invent a scope that isn't listed. Full type→emoji mapping: `/workspaces/.dev/commit-convention.json`.
Use `/commit` (Claude Code slash command) to auto-generate a message from staged changes.

**Git workflow**: branch, commit by subject (Conventional Commits), push only once it looks safe
(human review of the diff recommended first, ask if unsure), open a PR — never merge, merging is
always a human decision. See AGENTS.md's Git Workflow section for the full policy and how a narrow
per-task carve-out (e.g. "push straight to `main` for this one fix") can be granted.

## AI persistence

`~/.claude` is bind-mounted from a **per-devcontainer** volume and symlinked at
every container start by `claude-dev` — isolated to this project, not shared
with any other org's devcontainer. Memory, credentials, and settings survive
rebuilds of this same devcontainer. Remote Control (`claude-rc status`) lets you start sessions
in this devcontainer from claude.ai/code or the Claude mobile app.
